    \n\nI am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to d
    \n\n, to see, and to experience.
    \n\nI like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream;
    \n\nI like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
    \n\nI like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face,
    \n\nI like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with
    \n\na blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the
    \n\nnight. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.
    \n\nI like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded
    \n\nby people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake
    \n\nin Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable
    \n\nshoes; I like good books and romantic movies.
    \n\nI like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</string>
